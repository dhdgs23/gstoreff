              At Garena, we strive to ensure a seamless and satisfactory experience for all our users. As the official and trusted store, we are committed to transparency. This policy outlines the conditions under which refunds can be processed for purchases made on our website.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-semibold !mt-12 !mb-4">1. General Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Due to the digital nature of our products (in-game items and currency), all sales are generally considered final. However, we understand that exceptional circumstances can occur. Refund requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are subject to the terms outlined below.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-semibold !mt-12 !mb-4">2. UPI Payments</h2>
            <p>
              You are eligible for a full refund under the following conditions:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>
                Your payment was successful, but the purchased item was not delivered to your game account, and the order status is marked as "Failed" in your order history.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the event of a "Failed" order, any coins used for that purchase will be automatically returned to your coin wallet. If the coins are not returned, please contact us.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-semibold !mt-12 !mb-4">3. Redeem Code Purchases</h2>
            <p>
              Purchases made using a Redeem Code are typically non-refundable once the code has been submitted and the order is in "Processing" or "Completed" status. This is because the codes are processed through third-party systems. However, if you believe there was a technical error during the redemption process, you may still submit a refund request for review.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-semibold !mt-12 !mb-4">4. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
            <p>
              We are unable to provide refunds in the following situations:
            </p>
             <ul className="list-disc list-outside space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>
                You entered the wrong Free Fire Gaming ID during purchase. It is the user's responsibility to ensure the ID is correct.
              </li>
              <li>
                You have changed your mind after a successful purchase and delivery of the item.
              </li>
               <li>
                Bans or restrictions on your game account due to violations of Garena's game policies.
              </li>
               <li>
                Issues related to in-game mechanics or items after successful delivery.
              </li>
            </ul>
